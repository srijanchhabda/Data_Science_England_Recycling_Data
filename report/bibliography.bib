abstract = "For a proper understanding of many informetric concepts, a basis in statistics is indispensable. For this reason, this chapter introduces both descriptive and inferential statistics. In the first part (descriptive statistics), we introduce the difference between nominal, ordinal and interval scales, and the relation to bar diagrams and histograms. Various measures of central tendency. measures of statistical dispersion are explained, and two procedures for determining percentiles (quantiles) are covered in this section. We then turn to the graphical representation in a scatter plot and ways of finding the best fitting line (linear regression) in the resulting cloud of points. Inequality in causes and effects can be visualized and quantified using the Lorenz curve and Gini index. The second part (inferential statistics) introduces the normal distribution and the z-score. The chapter closes by providing two nonparametric methods for hypothesis testing the chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney U-test."

    abstract = { This study merges insights from two well-known attitude-behavior theories—the theory of planned behavior and the model of altruistic behavior—with elements from two broader models from environmental psychology—the model of environmental behavior and the model of environmental concern—to propose a comprehensive structural equation model to explain recycling behavior. The specified model is estimated using data from the most recent national survey performed in Portugal on the subject. In general, results support the use of the theory of planned behavior as a basis for modeling recycling participation. However, the integration of this theory with the Schwartz's model is only partially achieved. Another important finding is that recycling behavior is indirectly determined by personal psychological features, such as social conscience, but not by general ecological attitudes. }
