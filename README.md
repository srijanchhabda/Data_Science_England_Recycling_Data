# COMSM0017 Applied Data Science Project

This repository contains the code used to analyse and correlate recycling data from [WasteDataFlow](wastedataflow.org) and the
[Environmental Agency](https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/publisher/11c51f05-a8bf-4f58-9b95-7ab55f9546d7) in order to predict future recycling rates.

## Research Questions

- Do more densely populated areas recycle more or less (urban vs rural areas)?
- Do local authorities that spend more on recycling facilities end up with higher recycling efficiency?
- Does the average wealth of people in a region have an impact (index of deprivation)?
- If a county is bad at recycling, are the surrounding counties also bad (spatial element)?
- How relevant are figures from previous years (temporal element)?
